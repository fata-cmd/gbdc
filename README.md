[GBDC](https://github.com/Udopia/gbdc) provides efficient implementations of functions for benchmark instance identification, instance feature extraction and instance transformation.
GBDC provides a command-line tool as well as the Python package `gbdc`.
The Python package `gbdc` is used by [Global Benchmark Database](https://github.com/Udopia/gbd).

## [Documentation](doc/Index.html)

GBDC provides benchmark instance identifiers, feature extractors, and instance transformers for several problem domains, including propositional satisfiability (SAT) and optimization (MaxSAT), as well as Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO).
A description of the supported domains, feature extractors, and instance transformers can be found in the [documentation](doc/Index.html).

## Installation

* GBDC uses `libarchive` for reading from a large variety of compressed formats (in some systems provided by the package `libarchive-dev`).
* Some GBDC functions use an [IPASIR](https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir) SAT Solver. GBDC's build-system pulls the external SAT Solver [CaDiCaL](http://fmv.jku.at/cadical/) by A. Biere (MIT licensed).

### Steps:
1. **Install libarchive**
   - For Ubuntu: `apt install libarchive-dev`
   - For macOS: `brew install libarchive`

2. Inside the directory containing this repository run the installation script `install-pymod.sh`.

### Experimental:
The PyPI package `gbdc` contains pre-built distributions that can be installed via `pip install gbdc`. However, please note that some platform-specific distributions may be missing and that existing ones have not undergone extensive testing yet.
<!-- #### Shipped Dependencies

* A copy of the command-line argument parser by P. S. Kumar [`argparse.h`](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse) (MIT licensed) resides in the `lib` folder.

* A copy of the [MD5 hash](https://github.com/CommanderBubble/MD5) implementation by M. Lloyd (MIT licensed) resides in the `lib` folder. -->

    * [*Recognition and Exploitation of Gate Structure in SAT Solving* (2020, Iser)](https://d-nb.info/1209199122/34)

* The Python module `gbdc` is used in our project [GBD Benchmark Database](https://github.com/Udopia/gbd)
